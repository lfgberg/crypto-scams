# Crypto Safety Best Practices

* **MFA** - Enable multi-factor authentication on accounts for crypto wallets, exchanges, etc. Consider the use of a hardware token such as a Yubikey.
* **Protect Private Keys & Seed Phrases** - Treat these like the keys to your bank account, never share them with anyone or on cloud services. Keep them in a secure offline location.
* **Use Hot & Cold Wallets** - Seperate your funds between wallets connected to the internet that are used for frequent transactions, and offline wallets for long time storage.
* **Use Trusted Exchanges** - Only trade on trusted exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, etc. as opposed to untrustworthy platforms or decentralized exchanges.
* **Monitor Your Accounts** - Regularly review your wallet and exchange accounts for unauthorized transactions or suspicious activity.
