# Next Steps

## Evaluating a Potential Scam

1. **Research** - Research the whitepaper, project team, and future goals.
2. **Check Blacklists** - Check blacklists such as [California's Scam Tracker](https://dfpi.ca.gov/consumers/crypto/crypto-scam-tracker/), and [Badbitcoin](https://badbitcoin.org/). Research the project team to determine if they've been associated with any other known scams.
3. **Identify Red Flags** - Use the red flag checklist to identify potential red flags.
4. **Use Caution**  - Understand that once you send crypto you'll likely never be able to get it back. The blockchain doesn't allow for transactions to be changed, don't put in more than you're willing to lose.

## What to do if You've Fallen Victim

1. Stop interacting with the scammer/project.
2. Report the crime to your local police department.

   * [Securities and Exchange Commission fraud reporting](https://www.sec.gov/submit-tip-or-complaint/tips-complaints-resources/report-suspected-securities-fraud-or-wrongdoing)
   * [FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center complaint](https://www.ic3.gov/Home/FileComplaint)

4. Change your passwords for any affected platforms.
5. If your wallet was compromised, move all funds to a new address that you control.
6. Don't engage with crypto recovery services.
